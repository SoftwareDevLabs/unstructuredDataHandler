## SDLC_core Roadmap / Timeline

Below is the schedule for when milestones will be included in release builds of Windows Terminal and Windows Terminal Preview. The dates are rough estimates and are subject to change.

## Issue Triage & Prioritization

Incoming issues/asks/etc. are triaged several times a week, labeled appropriately, and assigned to a milestone in priority order:

* P0 (serious crashes, data loss, etc.) issues are scheduled to be dealt with ASAP
* P1/2 issues/features/asks  assigned to the current or future milestone
* Issues/features/asks not on our list of features above are assigned to the [Terminal Backlog](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/milestone/7) for subsequent triage, prioritization & scheduling.
